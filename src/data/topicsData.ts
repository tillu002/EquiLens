behind their children leaving school. Common issues included financial constraints, lack of

one instance, it was noted that parental illiteracy played a significant role, with parents
discontinuing their childrenâ€™s education due to a lack of understanding of its value. These
insights emphasized the need for targeted awareness programs and support to address these
barriers effectively`,

labor, early marriages, and the significance of equal educational opportunities. The campaign

motivated them by explaining the opportunities education can provide for a brighter future.
We also discussed with their families the importance of schooling and sought to connect them
with resources or initiatives that could support their return to school.`,
